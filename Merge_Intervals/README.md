## Merge Intervals
This pattern describes the efficient technique to deal with overlapping intervals. We need to find overlapping intervals or merge intervals if they overlap. There will be six type of overlap between two intervals a, b: 
- a and b not overlap
- a overlap b and b end after a
- a overlap b completely 
- b overlap a and a end after b
- b overlap a completely
- a and b do not overlap
